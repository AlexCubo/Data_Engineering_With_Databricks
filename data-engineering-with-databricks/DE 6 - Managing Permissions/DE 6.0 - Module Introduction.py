# MAGIC This course cannot be delivered on Databricks Community Edition, and can only be delivered on clouds supporting Unity Catalog. Administration access at both the workspace and account level is required to fully perform all exercises. A few optional tasks are demonstrated that additionally require low-level access to the cloud environment.
